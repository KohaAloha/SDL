Extension

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use SDL;
 use SDLx::App;
 use SDL::Event;
 use SDL::Events;

 # this is all the code we need to have a working app!
 my $app = SDLx::App->new;

 # we can also specify many useful things in the constructor
 my $app = SDLx::App->new(
     title      => 'My Great Game',
     width      => 1024,
     height     => 600,

     centered   => 1,
     no_frame   => 1,
     async_blit => 1,
 );

 # our app also comes with an SDLx::Controller

 # add a handler handle events such as keypresses
 $app->add_event_handler(
     sub {
          my ($event) = @_;
          # handle the event here
     }
 );

 # add a handler to move our objects in response to time
 $app->add_move_handler(
     sub {
         # handle moving objects here
     }
 );

 # add a handler to show our objects on the screen
 $app->add_show_handler(
     sub {
         # handle drawing objects here
     }
 );

 # finally, start the app run loop with the added handlers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<SDLx::App> provides methods for the root window of your SDL application,
as well as many related convenience methods.
It is a subclass of both L<SDLx::Surface> and L<SDLx::Controller>,
providing all the methods they both provide.

Initializes SDL with L<SDLx::App::init|/init>,
creates the root window with L<SDL::Video::set_video_mode|SDL::Video/set_video_mode>,
initializes an L<SDLx::Controller> belonging to the app,
and performs many other app management tasks all as specified by named parameters.
Returns an L<SDLx::Surface> of the new app.

The complete set of parameters are shown in the code above and explained in detail below.
When constructing the app's L<SDLx::Controller> all parameters specified are also given to
L<< SDLx::Controller->new|SDLx::Controller/new >>, so should be specified here. See
L<SDLx::Controller>.

=over

=item width

The window width, in pixels. Defaults to 640. Alias: C<w>.

=item height

The window height, in pixels. Defaults to 480. Alias: C<h>.

=item depth

The surface's color depth, in bits per pixel. Should be 8, 16, 24 or 32.
If not defined, defaults to 32 and specifies the
L<SDL_ANYFORMAT|SDL::Video/CONSTANTS> flag. Alias: C<d>.

=item title

The window's title, as a string. Defaults to the L</icon_title> if defined, or the file name.

=item icon_title

The application's icon title, as a string. Defaults to the L</title> if defined, or the file name.

=item icon

The application's icon. Set with L</icon>.

=item init

The SDL subsystems to initialize, as a product of the L<SDL init constants|SDL/CONSTANTS> or an array ref.
The video subsystem is initialized no matter what, and does not need to be specified.
The specified value is passed to L<SDLx::App::init|/init>, so see that for more details.
Defaults to L<SDL_INIT_EVERYTHING|SDL/CONSTANTS>. Alias: C<initialize>.

=item flags

L<SDL::Video flags|SDL::Video/CONSTANTS to specify when calling
L<SDL::Video::set_video_mode|SDL::Video/set_video_mode>.
Flags should be bitwise I<or'ed> together when passing more than one (C<flags => FOO|BAR>).
All flags have a corresponding named parameter which can be used instead of specifying them here,
and are explained below.
Defaults to no flags, or to L<SDL_ANYFORMAT|SDL::Video/CONSTANTS> if the C<depth> parameter was undefined.
Alias: C<f>.

=item sw_surface

The L<SDL_SWSURFACE|SDL::Video/CONSTANTS> flag, as a boolean. If true, creates the surface in
system memory. This is best used when you plan to do per-pixel manipulations,
or blit surfaces with alpha channels. Aliases: C<software_surface>, C<sw>.

=item hw_surface

The L<SDL_HWSURFACE|SDL::Video/CONSTANTS> flag, as a boolean. If true, creates the surface in
video memory. This is best used when the surfaces you'll be blitting are also hardware surfaces.
SDL copies the surfaces from video memory to system memory when you L<lock|SDL::Video/lock_surface> them,
and back when you L<unlock|SDL::Video/unlock_surface> them, which can cause a major performance hit.
If the video driver does not support hardware surfaces, a software surface will be returned instead.
Many platforms can only provide hardware surfaces when using L<SDL_FULLSCREEN|SDL::Video/CONSTANTS>.
Aliases: C<hardware_surface>, C<hw>.

=item async_blit

The L<SDL_ASYNCBLIT|SDL::Video/CONSTANTS> flag, as a boolean. If true, enables the use of asynchronous updates
of the display surface. This will usually slow down blitting on single-CPU machines, but can speed up blitting
on multi-CPU machines. Alias: C<asynchronous_blit>.

=item any_format

The L<SDL_ANYFORMAT|SDL::Video/CONSTANTS> flag, as a boolean. If a video surface of the requested
bits-per-pixel (bpp) is not available SDL will normally emulate one with a shadow surface.
Passing a true value prevents this and causes SDL to use the video surface, regardless of its pixel depth.
This flag is specified automatically when the L</depth> parameter is undefined.

=item hw_palette

The L<SDL_HWPALETTE|SDL::Video/CONSTANTS> flag, as a boolean. If true, gives SDL exclusive palette access.
Without this flag you may not always get the exact colors you request with
L<SDL::Video::set_colors|SDL::Video/set_colors> or L<SDL::Video::set_palette|SDL::Video/set_palette>.
Alias: C<hardware_palette>.

=item double_buf

The L<SDL_DOUBLEBUF|SDL::Video/CONSTANTS> flag, as a boolean. If true, enables hardware double buffering;
faster, but only valid with a hardware surface. L<flip|SDLx::Surface/flip> should be used to flip the buffers
and update the screen. All drawing will take place on the surface that is not being displayed.
If double buffering could not be enabled then L<flip|SDLx::Surface/flip> will just perform an
L<update_rect|SDLx::Surface/update_rect> on the entire screen. Aliases: C<double_buffer>, C<dbl_buf>.

=item fullscreen

The L<SDL_FULLSCREEN|SDL::Video/CONSTANTS> flag, as a boolean. If true, SDL will attempt to use a fullscreen mode,
changing the hardware resolution to the resolution of the display surface.
If, for whatever reason, this change is not possible the next higher resolution will be used
and the display surface centered on a black background. Alias: C<full_screen>.

=item open_gl

The L<SDL_OPENGL|SDL::Video/CONSTANTS> flag, as a boolean. If true, creates an OpenGL rendering context.
This uses any C<gl> attributes specified and any others set with L</gl_attribute>. Alias: C<opengl>.

=item resizable

The L<SDL_RESIZABLE|SDL::Video/CONSTANTS> flag, as a boolean. If true, creates a resizable window.
When the window is resized by the user a L<SDL_VIDEORESIZE|SDL::Events/CONSTANTS> event
is generated and L</resize> should be called with the new size.

=item no_frame
The L<SDL_NOFRAME|SDL::Video/CONSTANTS> flag, as a boolean. If true, SDL attempts to create a window
with no title bar or frame decoration. Fullscreen modes automatically have this flag set.

=item centered

A boolean value. If true, centers the window on the screen using C<$ENV{SDL_VIDEO_CENTERED}>.
Alias: C<center>.

=item position

The position of the window on the screen, as an array ref. The array ref should be two elements long,
specifying C<x> and C<y> values, in pixels, used to position the window on the screen.
Implemented using C<$ENV{SDL_VIDEO_WINDOW_POS}>. Alias: C<pos>.

=item no_cursor

A boolean value. If true, hides the cursor on the video surface using L</show_cursor>.
A surface can then instead be blitted to the display at the location of the cursor.

=item grab_input

A boolean value. If true, SDL attempts to confine the cursor to the window using L</grab_input>.
Also, nearly all keyboard input will be passed directly to the application,
and not interpreted by any window manager present.

=item no_controller

A boolean value. If true, does not initialize an L<SDLx::Controller> for the app.
Care should then be taken to not use any of L<SDLx::Controller>s methods.

=item stash

A place to store any information you need the app to hold. This can then be returned and set with
L</stash>. If not specified, defaults to an empty hash ref.

=back

=head2 init

 SDLx::App::init( SDL::SDL_INIT_TIMER | SDL::SDL_INIT_AUDIO | ... );
 SDLx::App::init( [ 'timer', 'audio', 'video', 'cd_rom', 'cdrom', 'joystick',
                    'everything', 'all', 'no_parachute', 'event_thread' ]  );

This is not a method, but a sub. It is used internally by L</new> to init SDL with
L<SDL::init|SDL/init>. If any subsystems are already initialized, it will use
L<SDL::init_sub_system|SDL/init_sub_system> instead. You should use this whenever you need to
init anything outside calls to </new>.

If a number is specified, it will initialize SDL in the same way as L<SDL::init|SDL/init> describes.
If an array ref is specified, each element should be a string corresponding to a flag to specify.
The strings and their corresponding flags are shown in the table below. See L<SDL::init|SDL/init> for
descriptions of what each flag does.

 flag                    string          alias
 ====================    ============    ======
 SDL_INIT_TIMER          timer
 SDL_INIT_AUDIO          audio
 SDL_INIT_VIDEO          video
 SDL_INIT_CDROM          cd_rom          cdrom
 SDL_INIT_JOYSTICK       joystick
 SDL_INIT_EVERYTHING     everything      all
 SDL_INIT_NOPARACHUTE    no_parachute
 SDL_INIT_EVENTTHREAD    event_thread

=head2 screen_size

 my ($screen_w, $screen_h) = SDLx::App::screen_size();

Returns the width and height of the user's screen resolution using
L<SDL::Video::get_video_info|SDL::Video/get_video_info>.
This can be called before or after calling L</new>.
Initializing the video subsytem will be handled correctly no matter what thanks to
L<SDLx::App::init|/init>.

=head2 set_video_mode

 my $app = SDLx::App->set_video_mode( $w, $h, $d, $f );
 $app->set_video_mode( $w, $h, $d, $f );

The first form is used internally by L</new> to create the new SDL display surface.
The second form can be used to change the video mode of an existing app.
See L<SDL::Video::set_video_mode|SDL::Video/set_video_mode> for a description on what the
four arguments do.

=head2 resize

 $app->resize( $w, $h );

Resize the app to the specified width and height. The surface's depth and flags will remain the same.

=head2 fullscreen

Toggles the app in and out of fullscreen mode in a cross-platform-friendly way.
Returns false if the app fails to go fullscreen for some reason. Otherwise, returns true.

=head2 iconify

Attempts to iconify the window with L<SDL::Video::wm_iconify_window|SDL::Video/wm_iconify_window>.

=head2 title()

=head2 title( $new_title )

=head2 title( $window_title, $icon_title )

C<SDLx::App::title> takes 0, 1, or 2 arguments. If no parameter is given,
it returns the current application window title. If one parameter is
passed, both the window title and icon title will be set to its value.
If two parameters are passed the window title will be set to the first,
and the icon title to the second.

=head2 error

C<SDLx::App::error> returns the last error message set by the SDL.

=head2 resize( $width, $height )

C<SDLx::App::resize> takes a new width and height of the application. Only
works if the application was originally created with the resizable option.

=head2 fullscreen

C<SDLx::App::fullscreen> toggles the application in and out of fullscreen mode.

=head2 iconify

C<SDLx::App::iconify> iconifies the application window.

=head2 grab_input( $CONSTANT )

C<SDLx::App::grab_input> can be used to change the input focus behavior of
the application. It takes one argument, which should be one of the following:

=over 4

=item * SDL_GRAB_QUERY

=item * SDL_GRAB_ON

=item * SDL_GRAB_OFF

=back

=head2 sync

C<SDLx::App::sync> encapsulates the various methods of syncronizing the screen with the
current video buffer. C<SDLx::App::sync> will do a fullscreen update, using the double buffer
or OpenGL buffer if applicable. This is prefered to calling flip on the application window.

=head2 attribute( $attr )

=head2 attribute( $attr, $value )

C<SDLx::App::attribute> allows one to get and set GL attributes. By passing a value
in addition to the attribute selector, the value will be set. C<SDL:::App::attribute>
always returns the current value of the given attribute, or Carp::confesss on failure.
