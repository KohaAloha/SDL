SDLx::Surface - Graphic surface matrix extension

=head1 CATEGORY

Extension

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use SDL;
 use SDL::Video;
 use SDLx::Surface;

 # Create the main surface (display)
 SDL::init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO);
 my $display = SDL::Video::set_video_mode(640, 480, 16, SDL_SWSURFACE);

 my $surf_matrix = SDLx::Surface->new( surface => $display);
 
 $surf__matrix->[10][10] = 0xFFFF; #for 16bpp write white at x = 10 and y=10

 $surf_matrix->surface( $new_surface );

 my $orig_surface = $surf_matrix->surface();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An C<SDLx::Surface> allows matrix read and write to a surface, safely. 

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Takes a SDL::Surface in hash format.

If a surface is passed to 'surface =>' that is loaded. Otherwise you can define at least a width and a height. 

	SDLx::Surface->new(  surface => $surface) # The $surface is loaded

	SDLx::Surface->new( width=> 400, height=>200) 
		# A SDL::Surface->new( SDL_ANYFORMAT, 400, 200, 32) is loaded

	SDLx::Surface->new( width=> 400, height=>200, flags=> SDL_SWSURFACE, depth=>24 ) 
	  	# A SDL::Surface->new( SDL_SWSURFACE, 400, 200, 24) is loaded 

	SDLx::Surface->new( width=> 400, height=>200, flags=> SDL_SWSURFACE, depth=>32, greenmask=>0xFF000000 )
		# A SDL::Surface->new( SDL_ANYFORMAT, 400, 200, 32, 0, 0xFF000000,0, 0, 0 ) is loaded

=head2 surface

If a SDL::Surface is passed it is attached to the matrix. Returns the SDL::Surface that is currently attached to this SDLx::Surface
